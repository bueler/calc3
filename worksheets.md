## Worksheets and Matlab codes

PDFs for in-class Worksheets, and their solutions, will appear below in the table as they occur.  You **do not** have to turn-in any Worksheet!

This is also the place to find Matlab codes which I used in occasional in-class demonstrations.  You can use either [Matlab online](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) or [Octave online](https://octave-online.net/) to try these codes, or get [Matlab on your own machine](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html).  If you are new to Matlab, perhaps read these short PDFs from David Maxwell's courses:

  * [MATLAB Basics](assets/worksheets/S23/MatlabBasics.pdf), which includes an intro to 2D plotting
  * [MATLAB 3d Graphics](assets/worksheets/S23/Matlab3dPlot.pdf), including usage of `meshgrid`, `surf`, and `contour`
