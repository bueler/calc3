## Matlab codes

The page shows Matlab codes which I used in occasional in-class demonstrations, and some codes which I have written to help me with the homework.  They are listed below in chronological order.

  * [cubiccurvature.m](assets/codes/S23/cubiccurvature.m), a curvature illustration in Section 3.3 -> [output image](assets/codes/S23/cubiccurvature.png)
  * [contourfocus.m](assets/codes/S23/contourfocus.m), minimum illustration in Section 4.7 -> [output image](assets/codes/S23/contourfocus.png)
  * [exercise344.m](assets/codes/S23/exercise344.m), color figure for #344 in Section 4.7 -> [output image](assets/codes/S23/exercise344.png)
  * [exercise1.m](assets/codes/S23/exercise1.m), midpoint rule for double integral on #1 in Section 5.1
  * [exercise67.m](assets/codes/S23/exercise67.m), midpoint rule for double integral on #67 in Section 5.2
  * [exercise100.m](assets/codes/S23/exercise100.m), midpoint rule for double integral on #100 in Section 5.2
  * [bumpysphere.m](assets/codes/S23/bumpysphere.m), plot a bumpy sphere (Section 2.7) -> [output image](assets/codes/S23/bumpysphere.png)
  * [twofields.m](assets/codes/S23/twofields.m), plot vector fields using Matlab's _quiver_ (Section 6.1) -> [output image](assets/codes/S23/twofields.png)
  * [surfaces.m](assets/codes/S23/surfaces.m), plot parameterized surfaces for #274, #277, #281 in Section 6.6 -> [output image](assets/codes/S23/surfaces.png)

### Getting started with Matlab

You can use either [Matlab online](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) or [Octave online](https://octave-online.net/).  Also you can run [Matlab on your own machine](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html).  If you are new to Matlab, try reading either [Matlab's "Getting Started" tutorial](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html), or perhaps these short PDFs from David Maxwell's courses:

  * [MATLAB Basics](assets/codes/S23/MatlabBasics.pdf), which includes an intro to 2D plotting
  * [MATLAB 3d Graphics](assets/codes/S23/Matlab3dPlot.pdf), including usage of `meshgrid`, `surf`, and `contour`
