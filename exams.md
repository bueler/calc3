### Exams from Previous Semesters

These exams can be good study guides, but they covered various different ranges of sections, may have used different textbooks, and were written by various instructors.  For additional old exams see [Prof. Maxwell's Past Exams page](https://damaxwell.github.io/math253/exams.html).
