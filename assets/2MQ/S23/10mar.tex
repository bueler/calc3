I do not know how to calculate this integral exactly:
  $$\int_0^3 \frac{dx}{x + e^x}$$
But I can approximate it arbitrarily well.  Use the midpoint rule with $m=3$ equal-length subintervals to compute a simple approximation.  (\emph{No need to use a calculator for now.  Just find the $x$-values to plug in, and proceed to write a numerical expression for the answer.})
