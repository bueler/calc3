For \textbf{cylindrical coordinates}, sketch the ``standard illustration'' just like I have done in recent lectures.  That is, show the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes as usual in 3D.  Then locate a point $(r,\theta,z)$, and write down the formulas that get you from $(x,y,z)$ back-and-forth to $(r,\theta,z)$.  Now flip over the sheet and do the same for \textbf{spherical coordinates}.
