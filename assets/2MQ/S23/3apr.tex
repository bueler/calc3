For \textbf{cylindrical coordinates}, sketch the standard illustration just like I have done in recent lectures.  That is, show the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes as usual in 3D, then locate a point $(r,\theta,z)$.  Write down the formulas that get you from $(x,y,z)$ to $(r,\theta,z)$ and back.  Now flip over the sheet and do all the same steps for \textbf{spherical coordinates}.
